- **Database:** Optimized queries with proper indexing
- **Frontend:** Fast loading with code splitting for plugins

### Security
- **Data Protection:** Encrypted sensitive data
- **API Security:** Proper authentication on all endpoints
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize all user inputs
- **Environment Separation:** Clear development/production boundaries

### Compatibility
- **Browser Support:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 12+ compatibility
- **Node.js:** LTS version support
- **Deployment:** Replit and Docker container support

## User Experience Requirements

### Core UX Principles

- **Consistent Design:** Unified look and feel across core and plugins
- **Responsive Layout:** Works seamlessly on all device sizes
- **Fast Performance:** No unnecessary loading or delays
- **Error Feedback:** Clear, helpful error messages

### User Journeys

#### Contact Management Flow
1. User navigates to contacts section
2. Views contact list with search/filter options
3. Creates new contact with form validation
4. Edits existing contact information
5. Links contact to other business entities (invoices, projects)

#### Plugin Integration Flow
1. Developer creates plugin following core standards
2. Plugin registers with core system via config
3. Plugin appears in navigation automatically
4. Plugin data integrates with core entities (contacts)
5. Plugin operates independently but feels integrated

## Success Metrics

### Development Efficiency
- **Plugin Development Time:** 50% faster than building from scratch
- **Code Reusability:** 80% of core components reused across plugins
- **Bug Reduction:** Fewer integration issues due to standardized patterns

### System Performance
- **Uptime:** 99.9% availability
- **Response Time:** Sub-200ms API responses
- **User Satisfaction:** Positive feedback from development teams

## Release Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Foundation
- Complete contact management system
- Establish authentication framework
- Build plugin registration system
- Create UI component library

### Phase 2: First Plugin
- Refactor existing invoices into plugin
- Validate plugin architecture
- Document plugin development process
- Test integration patterns

### Phase 3: Expansion
- Additional plugins by teams
- Advanced plugin features
- Performance optimizations
- Extended documentation

## Constraints & Considerations

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Plugin system cannot modify core files
- Database schema changes require migration strategy
- Environment portability is mandatory

### Business Constraints
- Internal use only (not external product)
- Development team focused (not end-user product)
- Must integrate with existing development workflow
- Cost-effective development and maintenance

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Support for multiple organizations
- **Advanced Auth:** SSO and enterprise authentication
- **Real-Time Features:** WebSocket support for live updates
- **Mobile App:** Native mobile application
- **API Gateway:** Centralized API management

### Scalability Planning
