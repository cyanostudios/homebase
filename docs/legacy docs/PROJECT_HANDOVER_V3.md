# Homebase v3 - Project Handover Summary

## Project Overview
**Homebase** is a plugin-based business application template designed for rapid development of custom business solutions. The core system handles essential functionality while plugins provide specialized features.

## Architecture Philosophy
- **Core System:** Essential business app infrastructure (contacts, auth, database, API, UI)
- **Plugin System:** Self-contained modules that extend functionality without modifying core
- **Team Independence:** Different teams can develop plugins independently
- **Universal Components:** Shared UI/UX patterns across all plugins

## Current State: v3 - Complete Business Contact System with UX Enhancements

### Changes from v2
- ✅ **Frontend loading issue resolved** - React app now renders properly
- ✅ **Complete CRUD functionality implemented** - Create, Read, Update, Delete for contacts
- ✅ **Advanced validation system** - Prevents duplicates and validates data
- ✅ **Professional UI/UX** - Error handling, disabled states, user feedback
- ✅ **Comprehensive business structure** - Full company/private person management
- ✅ **Advanced contact form** - Multi-level data structure with repeatable sections
- ✅ **Unsaved changes protection** - Warning dialogs when users have unsaved data
- ✅ **Consistent confirmation dialogs** - Professional delete confirmations

### Why v3?
Successfully resolved the frontend loading issue from v2 and implemented a complete contact management system with robust validation. Extended to comprehensive business structure supporting both companies and private persons with complex data relationships. Added professional UX features including unsaved changes warnings and consistent confirmation dialogs throughout the application.

```

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend:** Express.js + TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (planned)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Lucide React icons
- **Development:** Cursor IDE with AI assistance
- **Deployment:** Local development → Cloudways production (planned)

## Configuration

### Development Environment
- **Frontend:** Vite dev server on port 3001
- **Backend:** Express server on port 3002
- **Proxy:** Vite proxies `/api/*` requests to backend
- **Hot Reload:** Both frontend and backend support live reloading

### Key Files
- `vite.config.ts` - Frontend build config with path aliases and proxy
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript config with path mapping (`@/*` → `./client/src/*`)
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `.env.local` - Environment variables (preserved from v1)

## Design System

### Design System (v3)

#### Button Standards (Implemented)
- **Primary buttons:** Solid blue background + white text + icon (important actions)
- **Secondary buttons:** Blue background with 20% opacity + blue text + icon (other actions)
- **All buttons:** Must include lucide-react icons + consistent sizing

#### UI/UX Improvements
- **Reduced font sizes globally** - 16px→15px, 14px→13px for better density
- **Consistent input field styling** - Uniform sizing and appearance
- **Cleaner design** - Removed Card borders for minimalist approach
- **Enhanced UniversalPanel** - Fixed header/footer with scrollable content
- **Responsive layout** - Proper spacing and alignment throughout

### Component Architecture
- **UniversalPanel:** Reusable 672px-wide right panel with header/close/content areas
- **Plugin Pattern:** Each plugin provides components that integrate with UniversalPanel
- **State Management:** React Context for global state, local useState for component state

## Current Implementation

### Working Components (v3)
1. **UniversalPanel** - Enhanced panel with header/footer and scrollable content area
2. **AppContext** - Global state management for panel open/close and current data
3. **ContactList** - Shows contact list with "Add Contact" button and professional action buttons
4. **ContactForm** - Comprehensive business contact form with advanced features:
   - **Company/Private Toggle** - Conditional fields based on entity type
   - **Company Fields** - Name, type (AB/HB/KB/EF), org number, VAT number
   - **Private Fields** - Full name, personal number
   - **Repeatable Contact Persons** - Add/remove functionality for multiple contacts
   - **Repeatable Addresses** - Multiple address types (office, billing, shipping, etc)
   - **General Contact Details** - Email, website, phone 1, phone 2
   - **Tax & Business Settings** - Including F-Tax field
   - **Notes Section** - Additional information storage
   - **Unsaved Changes Protection** - Warning dialog when leaving with unsaved data
   - **Form Reset Functionality** - Clean form reset in create mode
5. **ConfirmDialog** - Reusable confirmation dialog component for dangerous actions
6. **useUnsavedChanges Hook** - Custom hook for tracking and handling unsaved form data
7. **Validation System** - Comprehensive validation with error messages and duplicate prevention
8. **CRUD Operations** - Full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for contacts

### Integration Flow
```
App.tsx
├── AppProvider (global state)
└── AppContent
    ├── ContactList (main content)
    └── UniversalPanel (right panel)
        └── ContactForm (when adding contact)
```

## Development Workflow

### How We Work Together

### How We Work Together

#### User Working Style
- **IDE:** Cursor IDE with AI assistance (GPT-4.1, Gemini)
- **Terminal Management:** Needs explicit guidance on which terminal to use
- **Multiple Terminals:** Usually runs 2-3 terminals simultaneously
  - Terminal 1: Frontend (Vite dev server)
  - Terminal 2: Backend (Express server)  
  - Terminal 3: Commands (git, file operations, curl tests)
- **File Management:** Manual copy/paste from artifacts for longer code files
- **Testing:** Likes to test each step before proceeding
- **Agent Usage:** Use sparingly - only when necessary

#### Claude (AI Assistant) Response Style
- **Direct commands only** - No long explanations unless critical
- **Code artifacts** - For longer code files (e.g., ContactForm.tsx) that user copies manually
- **Terminal commands** - "Write this in terminal 1" format
- **Clean code focus** - No code bloat, thoughtful changes only
- **Best practices** - Senior-level coding standards assumed
- **Minimal reasoning** - Trust user's judgment, provide direct solutions
- **One command per line** - Copy-pastable bash commands
- **Explicit paths** - Always specify full file paths and terminal numbers

#### Communication Pattern
```
User: "ok" or "error message" = Continue with next step
User: Shows terminal output = Analyze and provide fix
User: "prompta [agent]" = Create prompt for Cursor AI agent
Claude: Direct responses - "Write this in terminal 1" 
Claude: Code artifacts for longer files that need manual copy/paste
```

#### Code Quality Rules
- **Clean code only** - No unnecessary complexity or bloat
- **Thoughtful changes** - Every modification must have clear purpose
- **Best practices** - Follow senior developer standards
- **Minimal dependencies** - Don't add packages without clear need
- **Efficient solutions** - Prefer simple, direct approaches

### Command Structure
We work with **minimal terminal commands only** - no unnecessary explanations or comments in responses.

#### Example Good Response:
```bash
touch client/src/components/Button.tsx
```

#### Example Bad Response:
```bash
# Create a new button component for our design system
touch client/src/components/Button.tsx
# This will be used across all plugins for consistency
```

### Git Strategy
- **Branch:** `fresh-start-v2` (current working branch)
- **Backup:** `backup-legacy-state` tag contains v1 state
- **Preservation:** `/preservation/` folder contains working v1 components
- **Commit Style:** Functional, descriptive commits after each working feature

### AI Agent Usage
- **GPT-4.1:** For complex architecture, refactoring, debugging, systematic cleanup
- **Gemini:** For simple single-task changes, styling updates, file modifications
- **Claude (me):** For planning, step-by-step guidance, terminal commands, architecture decisions
- **Key Rule:** Agents must not install packages or guess - explicit instructions only
- **Prompt Strategy:** Create detailed prompts for agents with specific do's and don'ts

### Development Process
1. **Plan in small steps** - Never big changes at once
2. **Test each step** - Ensure functionality before proceeding  
3. **Use artifacts** - For code templates and documentation
4. **Terminal guidance** - Always specify which terminal to use
5. **Git frequently** - Commit working states often
