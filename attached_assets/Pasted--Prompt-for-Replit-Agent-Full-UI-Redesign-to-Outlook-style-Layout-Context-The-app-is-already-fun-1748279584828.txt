‚úÖ Prompt for Replit Agent ‚Äì Full UI Redesign to Outlook-style Layout
Context:
The app is already functionally complete. All match/referee logic, modals, sidebars, and interactivity are working well.
Now I want to completely redesign the UI layout while keeping all existing logic unchanged.

üéØ Goal: Redesign UI into a 3-column layout inspired by Microsoft Outlook
üñ•Ô∏è New Layout:
Topbar (full-width):

Should include primary actions like:

Add Match, Add Referee, Filters, and optional Search

Fixed at top, minimal height, always visible

Styled to match the new layout system

Column 1 ‚Äì Navigation Sidebar (Left):

Static vertical menu

Contains navigation: Dashboard, Matches, Referees, Stats, etc.

Narrow width (max 200px), full height

Column 2 ‚Äì Main View Area (Center):

Displays:

List of matches (if in Matches view)

List of referees (if in Referees view)

Dashboard cards (if in Dashboard)

Should use maximum available vertical space

Scrollable if needed

Column 3 ‚Äì Detail Panel (Right):

Replaces the previous dialog/sidebar system

This column shows:

Match info

Referee info

Forms (Add Match, Edit Ref, etc.)

Opens when a user selects something

Closes to return focus to column 2

Should support a max stack of 1 previous panel (existing logic)

üìê Design Constraints:
Use as much of the viewport as possible

Responsive layout that gracefully adjusts to smaller screens

Preserve all existing app context, state management, and logic

Do not change panel stacking or sidebar behavior ‚Äî only restructure where and how it is rendered

Keep animation logic (slide-in/out) as currently implemented for panel opening/closing

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Instructions:
Keep using Tailwind or existing styling system

Use grid/flex layout to structure the 3-column layout

All detail panels and forms should render in the third column, not as popups or dialogs

The structure should work with App.tsx as root, and manage layout at that level

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
Do not change any logic for match handling, referee assignment, activity logging, or API integration

This is a visual and structural redesign only

All features must remain intact and functional after layout is changed
