Prompt: Full project cleanup and audit task

You are an autonomous code maintenance agent.
Your task is to perform a full audit and cleanup of this application.

Scope:
Directory scan

Traverse the full project directory.

Identify unused or unreferenced files (e.g. old components, styles, debug scripts).

Mark or remove files that are not imported or used.

Database check

Inspect schema definitions and relationships.

Detect redundant fields, obsolete tables, or outdated data structures.

Search for duplicate entries across key tables (e.g. matches, referees, assignments, activities).

Identify orphaned rows (e.g. matches with no referees, referees with no assignments).

Generate safe deletion queries (SQL or ORM-level) and show a summary before execution.

Codebase inspection

Detect and remove unused imports.

Flag functions or components that are never called or exported.

Remove commented-out blocks that are no longer relevant.

Highlight any redundant logic or duplicate utility functions.

Dependency cleanup

Inspect package.json.

Identify unused dependencies or devDependencies.

Propose uninstall commands for unused packages.

Debugging artifacts

Locate temporary files such as logs, snapshots, .test.ts, .spec.ts, .bak, .tmp etc.

List candidates for deletion and remove if not required by test suites or scripts.

Activity logging integrity

Check that activity log entries include descriptive, specific change details (e.g. "Team category updated to U17").

Verify that string construction in activity creation reflects the new field values accurately.

Trace the final description string passed to storage.createActivity.

Execution guidelines:
Be non-destructive by default. For deletions, use dry-run and require confirmation.

Output clear summaries of:

Files or data removed

Optimizations made

Inconsistencies detected

Maintain logs of all actions and proposed actions.

Do not change application logic or routing unless explicitly instructed.

Output format:
